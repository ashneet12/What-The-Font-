    <pre>
      A <b class = "main">broken heart</b> is all that's left
      I'm still fixing all the cracks
      Lost a couple of pieces when
      <b>I carried it, carried it, carried it home...</b>
      
      I'm afraid of all I am
      My mind feels like a foreign land
      Silence ringing inside my head
      <b>Please carry me, carry me, carry me home...</b>
      
      I've spent all of the love I saved
      We were always a losing game
      Small town boy in a big arcade
      I got addicted to a <strong>losing game..</strong>
      
      <i>Oh, Oh......</i>
      
      All I know, all I know
      Loving you is a <strong>losing game..</strong>
      
      Do you love me, love me not?
      Giving pieces from my heart
      Tomorrow's coming and has gone
      <b>Still I carried, I carried, I carried on...</b>
      
      <i>Oh, Oh......</i>
      
      All I know, all I know
      Loving you is a <strong>losing game..</strong>
      
      <i>Oh, Oh......</i>
      
      All I know, all I know
      Loving you is a losing game
      I don't need your games, game over
      <b>Get me off this rollercoaster...</b>
      
      <i>Oh, Oh......</i>
      
      All I know, all I know
      Loving you is a <strong>losing game..</strong>
      
      <i>Oh, Oh......</i>
      All I know, all I know
      Loving you is a <strong>losing game..</strong>
